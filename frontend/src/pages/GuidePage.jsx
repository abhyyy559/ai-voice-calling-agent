          An agent is one AI caller persona. Click <strong>+ New Agent</strong> and the builder wizard walks you
          through six steps:
        </p>
        <ul className="guide-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Basics</strong> — name it, describe when it calls, and edit the opening disclosure the agent
            must speak ("this is an automated call…").
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Company Context</strong> — facts the agent should know (timings, fees, department numbers). It
            uses these to answer questions instead of guessing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Question Flow</strong> — the exact questions to ask, in order, and which field each answer
            fills.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extraction Schema</strong> — what to write down per call (e.g. <code>reason</code>,{' '}
            <code>will_attend</code>) with types and confidence thresholds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Voice Settings</strong> — pick the voice and speaking pace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Review &amp; Save Version</strong> — saving creates an immutable numbered version (v1, v2, …).
            Editing never silently changes what campaigns call.
          </li>
        </ul>

    body: (
      <>
        <p>
          Pick a saved version and press start — your browser microphone becomes the caller's phone. Three things
          to expect:
        </p>
        <ul className="guide-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Mic permission</strong> — the browser asks once; allow it or nothing can be heard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Talking turns</strong> — speak, then stop. The agent waits for natural pauses before
            replying, and you can interrupt it mid-sentence (barge-in), just like a real call.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Captions</strong> — both sides of the conversation appear as live captions while you talk.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After hanging up you get the transcript, every field the agent extracted with confidence scores, and
          per-turn latency. Playground calls use no phone numbers and no minutes.

        <p>
          A campaign dials real people from a contact list using one pinned agent version. Create it, then import
          contacts:
        </p>
        <ul className="guide-list">
          <li>
            Drop in a <strong>.csv or .xlsx</strong> file — columns are read automatically, no typing column names.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confirm the suggested mapping (name, phone, plus any extra fields) against a preview of your rows.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rows with invalid phone numbers are flagged <em>before</em> anything is submitted, so bad data never
            reaches the dialer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Calls only run inside the permitted calling window (9 AM–9 PM IST) once you launch.</p>

        Every finished call keeps its full transcript, the structured fields collected (with confidence), cost and
        latency stats, and the recording where available. Calls the agent was unsure about are flagged for human
        review. Export everything to CSV or Excel from the campaign page in one click.

      <p>
        Launching is deliberate: the campaign page asks for confirmation, then dials queued contacts inside
        calling hours only. Pause anytime to stop new dials without losing progress; cancel to end everything.
        Contacts without recorded consent, opted-out numbers, and out-of-window times are skipped automatically.
        Regional rollout (Telugu and beyond) comes in a later phase.
